<hr>
<p>
  Thank you for your interest in attending Portland Code School! Please be sure to review our <a href="classes.html">classes page</a> to decide which of our courses best fits your needs. If you aren't sure which class is for you, feel free to <a href="mailto:ckelly@portlandcodeschool.com">email us</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
  We look for students who will work hard, challenge themselves, and be team players. This program is accelerated, and you will be required to put in time outside of class for learning, coding, and pairing if you want to succeed. Part of this applicaiton process is showing that you can learn new things and overcome technical challenges. Don't be intimidated if we ask you to do something you aren't familiar with yet! Use the linked resources we've provided, and you should be just fine. Show us you would be a stellar student at PCS!
</p>

<h3>Are You Ready?</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  Note: If you have no programming experience, we highly encourage you to apply for and attend our <a href="#">Primer course</a> before applying to either the Ruby on Rails or Full-Stack Javascript course.

    <li> A Gist of your cover letter. Describe your interest in programming, any experience you have coding, and how you function in a team work environment. Again, we love Markdown!</li>

  </ol>
</p>
