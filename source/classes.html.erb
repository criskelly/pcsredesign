                        <h4>Class Description</h4>
                    <p>This course is designed to help students learn how to build web applications and interactive website features from scratch using JavaScript as the primary language. Students will learn both front-end and back-end applications of JavaScript (including jQuery, BackboneJS, and NodeJS). Every web application needs JavaScript, so it’s an extremely powerful language to know, and the demand for JavaScript frameworks such as BackboneJS is only growing.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: Students with NO CODING EXPERIENCE should consider our Primer course before diving in to Full Stack JavaScript (see the Classes page for technical requirements). Students will be provided Treehouse accounts, and will be given access to the classroom from 9am-5pm M-F, as well as some Saturdays, leaving lots of time for independent and group learning. Students will primarily be working and learning in groups of 2-4 people</p>
                    <p>The Saturdays that are scheduled learning times (1 Saturday each month) will primarily consist of team building, portfolio development, and other technical areas (such as Github and Chrome’s Developer Tools) to round out the students’ curriculum, and broaden their exposure to web development tools.</p>

We start with an intense 1-month refresher on the Ruby language. After that, we dive into the Rails framework, still building our Ruby skills. Students will be expected to spend 2-3 hours studying outside of class for every hour spent in class.</p>

Students will primarily be working and learning in groups of 2-4 people. Also, PCS hosts a happy hour every other Friday at local restaurants to give students a chance to meet outside of class in a social environment.</p>
                        <p>The Saturdays that are scheduled learning times (1 Saturday each month) will primarily consist of team building, portfolio development, and other technical areas (such as jQuery, GitHub and the Chrome Dev Tools) to round out the students’ curriculum, and broaden their exposure to web development tools.</p>
